# MobileESP

**MobileESP** lets you easily detect and distinguish mobile visitors.

This is a fork from Anthony Hand's original [MobileESP](http://blog.mobileesp.com/).

Changes in this include removing all PHP 4 dependencies and fixing bugs here and there.

I have plans to make the interface incompatible with Anthony's copy, so take into account that this is not just a drop-in replacement.
